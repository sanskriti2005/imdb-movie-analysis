# imdb-movie-analysis
"What factors influence the success of a  movie on IMBD?” This project aims to answer that question using  various parameters like duration, genre, director etc.    This project involves working with data to analyze it and derive  insights from it that contribute towards better and profitable  filmmaking for producers. 

## APPROACH 
1st STEP: Data Cleaning –  
This step involves sorting and reprocessing data to make it 
suitable for analysis. The dataset used was cleaned in the 
following ways- 
- Removed columns, empty and unwanted values to prepare the 
data for analysis. 
- Cleaned values with unwanted characters for proper 
readability.  
 
2nd STEP: Data Analysis – 
The cleaned, processed data is then analyzed and insights are 
taken from it using methods like root cause analysis. Various 
questions are asked till we get down to the root of a problem to 
find solutions for it. This expands our parameters and 
understanding and brings out our full potential. 

## TECH-STACK USED
